# Python-For-Loop-example
This program reads all of the lines of the file, "WorldSeriesWinners.txt" into a list. It then determines the number of elements in the list and strips the trailing newline character using a for loop. It then asks the user to input the name of a baseball team. The program then checks to see if the team hasn't won a World Series or else determines how many times they have won the World Series. The result is then printed to the screen. The program then asks the user if they would like to search for another team.
